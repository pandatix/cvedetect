# Reporting Security Issues

Please report any security issues you discovered in the Go module to lucastesson@protonmail.com.

We will assess the risk, plus make a fix available before we create a GitHub issue.

In case the vulnerability is in a dependency, refers to their own security procedures.

Thank you for your contribution.
